## Spotify Music Search for CompuCorp

Hi CompuCorp, this is the solution that I did with the time I could muster on the weekend. It allows you to search for an artist 
or album, from which you can then click through to go to the spotify page pertaining to what you searched.

## Installation
You can just view the solution where I've hosted it on AWS (Amazon Web Services) for your convenience here:

Or you can simply clone this repository and just open the index.html file in the browser of your convenience.

## Usage
Simply enter an artist or album name in the search bar and click "Search". You can toggle between the artist and album search 
by pressing the relevant tab above where the results are displayed.

Your most recent searches are saved in case you want to go back to listen to those cool beats that you listened to the day before, 
easily and conveniently accessing them without having to type!
